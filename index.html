      I just want you to know that hurting you was never my       intention.
      If I could go back and choose differently, I would — every single time.<br>  
        You deserve all the happiness in the world.<br>
        I was with you always in form of someone, something that always hoped for your good.  
        Please give me a chance to make things right.
